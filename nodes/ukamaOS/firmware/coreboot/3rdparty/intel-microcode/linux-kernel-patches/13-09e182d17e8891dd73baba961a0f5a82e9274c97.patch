Subject: x86/microcode: Do not exit early from __reload_late()

Vitezslav reported a case where the

  "Timeout during microcode update!"

panic would hit. After a deeper look, it turned out that his .config had
CONFIG_HOTPLUG_CPU disabled which practically made save_mc_for_early() a
no-op.

When that happened, the discovered microcode patch wasn't saved into the
cache and the late loading path wouldn't find any.

This, then, lead to early exit from __reload_late() and thus CPUs waiting
until the timeout is reached, leading to the panic.

In hindsight, that function should have been written so it does not return
before the post-synchronization. Oh well, I know better now...
