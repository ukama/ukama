A range of NV indices are reserved for use by the TPM manufacturer,
and can be allocated arbitrarily, without the need to consult the TCG,
or any expectation that these be consistent across different models
of TPM. See 'Registery of reserved TPM 2.0 handles and localities' for
more details.

The range allocated to TPM manufacturers is 0x01000000 - 0x013fffff

This file documents indices that have been allocated as part of the TPM
implementation in cr50.
