coreboot 4.8 & 4.8.1 release notes
==================================

The 4.8.1 release contains 2 commits: 5f0b80b880 and 6794ce02d4.  This
minor release fixes an issue with adding payloads. The 4.8 release
covers commit 6dd2f69878 to commit ebdeb4d07d

Since the last release, the coreboot project had 1198 commits by 124
authors.

There are PGP signed 4.8 and 4.8.1 tags in the git repository.  A branch
for 4.8 releases (4.8_branch) has been created.

A big thank you to everyone involved in making this release happen. We
couldn't have done this without the 35 new commit authors, the
experienced developers, the many reviewers, documentation writers and
the fantastic community supporting users on both the mailing list and
the IRC channel.

In general, this has been a calm release cycle. Several old devices were
removed from the master branch early in the release, as they hinder
development and nobody stepped up doing the porting effort or was
willing to test coreboot on them. If there is the desire to get a board
back, it isn't lost as it’s still in the git history.

Intel i945 platform
-------------------
* On Intel 945 devices, native graphics initialization is now skipped
saving around 100 ms during resume from S3. The OS drivers need to be
able to handle that. Linux’ i915 driver is able to handle it, but not
the frame buffer driver.

AMD Stoney Ridge
----------------------------------
* Significant cleanup from older AGESA based platforms
* Fixes to get S3 working
* Updates to GPIO code to match other modern coreboot chips
* AGESA interface cleanup - Use native coreboot functions when
possible

Lenovo mainboards
-----------------
* Started integration of VBT (Video Bios Table) binary files to
support native graphics initialisation

Internal changes
----------------
* Rename of payload type 'payload' to 'simple_elf'
* Progress in removing typedef device_t
* Migrated all Intel platforms to a common VBT codebase
* Ongoing cleanup of whitespace, spelling and formatting
* Support for PCI in ramstage on non-x86
* Ongoing Intel platform code deduplication

Console changes
---------------
* Reduce default loglevel to DEBUG
* Introduce a way for mainboard to override the loglevel
* Restrict console messages to after console initialization
