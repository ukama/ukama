# Measured Boot
coreboot measured boot is implemented as Google Verified Boot extension. This
means in order to use it, vboot needs to be available for your platform. The
goal of this implementation is to implement an easy to understand and
transparent measured boot mechanism.

## IBB/CRTM
The "Initial Boot Block" or "Core Root of Trust for Measurement" is the first
code block loaded at reset vector and measured by a DRTM solution.
In case SRTM mode is active, the IBB measures itself before measuring the next
code block. In coreboot, cbfs files which are part of the IBB are identified
by a metatdata tag. This makes it possible to have platform specific IBB
measurements without hardcoding them.

## Known Limitations
At the moment measuring IBB dynamically and FMAP partitions are not possible but
will be added later to the implementation.

Also SoCs making use of VBOOT_RETURN_FROM_VERSTAGE are not able to use the
measured boot extension because of platform constraints.

## SRTM Mode
The "Static Root of Trust for Measurement" is the easiest way doing measurements
by measuring code before it is loaded.

### Measurements
SRTM mode measurements are done starting with the IBB as root of trust.
Only CBFS contents are measured at the moment.

#### CBFS files (stages, blobs)
* CBFS data is measured as raw data before decompression happens.
* CBFS header is excluded from measurements.
* Measurements are stored in PCR 2.

#### Runtime Data
* CBFS data which changes by external input dynamically. Never stays the same.
* It is identified by VBOOT_MEASURED_BOOT_RUNTIME_DATA kconfig option and
  measured into a different PCR 3 in order to avoid PCR pre-calculation issues.

### TCPA eventlog
coreboot makes use of its own TCPA log implementation. Normally the eventlog
specification can be found via the TCG homepage:

[UEFI Specification](https://trustedcomputinggroup.org/resource/tcg-efi-platform-specification/)

[BIOS Specification](https://www.trustedcomputinggroup.org/wp-content/uploads/TCG_PCClientImplementation_1-21_1_00.pdf)

Both of them are not representing firmware measurements in a generalized way.
Therefore we have to implement our own solution.

We decided to provide an easy to understand TCPA log which can be read out
from the operating system and firmware itself.

#### Table Format
The first column describes the PCR index used for measurement.
The second column is the hash of the raw data. The third column contains
the hash algorithm used in the operation. The last column provides
information about what is measured. First the namespace from where the data
came from, CBFS or FMAP, then the name used to look up the data
(region or file name).

## DRTM Mode
The "Dynamic Root of Trust for Measurement" is realised by platform features
like Intel TXT or Boot Guard. The features provide a way of loading a signed
"Authenticated Code Module" aka signed blob. Most of these features are also
a "Trusted Execution Environment", e.g. Intel TXT.

DRTM gives you the ability of measuring the IBB from a higher Root of Trust
instead of doing it yourself without any hardware support.

## Platform Configuration Register
Normally PCR 0-7 are reserved for firmware usage. In coreboot we use just 4 PCR
banks in order to store the measurements. coreboot uses the SHA-1 or SHA-256
hash algorithm depending on the TPM specification for measurements. PCR-4 to
PCR-7 are left empty.
