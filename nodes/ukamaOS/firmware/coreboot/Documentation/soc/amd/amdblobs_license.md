# License Agreement for amd_blobs Repository

## Abstract

AMD has generated a simpler and more flexible license agreement for using
proprietary precompiled binary images.  The new agreement is intended to cover
all blobs in the directory structure below where the license resides and
eliminates any unique agreements previously provided for individual products.

A [3rdparty/amd_blobs](https://review.coreboot.org/admin/repos/amd_blobs) repo
now exists for distributing new blobs to coreboot developers and consumers.
Images for older products will be moved to amd_blobs as time permits.

By cloning the amd_blobs repo, you will be agreeing to the license agreement
contained there.

## Text of License Agreement

The language of the agreement is duplicated below for your reference.  The
official license agreement may be found inside the Git repository.
