/**
 * @file post_codes.h
 */

/*
 * This aims to be a central point for POST codes used throughout coreboot.
 * All POST codes should be declared here as macros, and post_code() should
 * be used with the macros instead of hardcoded values. This allows us to
 * quickly reference POST codes when nothing is working
 *
 * The format for a POST code macro is
 * #define POST_WHAT_WE_COMMUNICATE_IS_HAPPENING_WHEN_THIS_CODE_IS_POSTED
 * Lets's keep it at POST_* instead of POST_CODE_*
 *
 * This file is also included by early assembly files. Only use #define s;
 * no function prototypes allowed here
 *
 * DOCUMENTATION:
 * Please document any and all post codes using Doxygen style comments. We
 * want to be able to generate a verbose enough documentation that is useful
 * during debugging. Failure to do so will result in your patch being rejected
 * without any explanation or effort on part of the maintainers.
