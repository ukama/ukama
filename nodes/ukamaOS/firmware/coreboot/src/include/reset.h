/*
 * SoC or board specific implementation of the board reset.
 *
 * Implementations shall meet the following criteria:
 *
 *   o For vboot support, the TPM MUST be reset.
 *
 *   o All SoC/chipset blocks SHOULD be reset except for those
 *     that are intentionally meant to survive reset (e.g. tomb-
 *     stone registers and that sort of stuff).
 *
 *   o All external SoC pins SHOULD return to power-on reset values.
 *
 *   o The CPU MUST resume execution from power-on reset vector
 *     (same as cold boot).
 *
 *   o Other board components (e.g. PCI, SDIO and stuff) SHOULD
 *     be reset.
 *
 *   o USB SHOULD be power-cycled.
 *
 *   o Board components that are intended to be fully independent
 *     from SoC (e.g. EC and EC-attached devices, the Cr50 on
 *     Chromebooks) SHOULD NOT be reset.
 *
 * General recommendations:
 *
 *   o DRAM SHOULD NOT lose power if possible.
 *
 *   o Reset time SHOULD be minimized
