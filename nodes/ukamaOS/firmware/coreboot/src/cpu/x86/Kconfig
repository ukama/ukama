config PARALLEL_CPU_INIT
	bool
	default n

config PARALLEL_MP
	def_bool n
	help
	 This option uses common MP infrastructure for bringing up APs
	 in parallel. It additionally provides a more flexible mechanism
	 for sequencing the steps of bringing up the APs.

config PARALLEL_MP_AP_WORK
	def_bool n
	depends on PARALLEL_MP
	help
	 Allow APs to do other work after initialization instead of going
	 to sleep.

config UDELAY_LAPIC
	bool
	default n

config LAPIC_MONOTONIC_TIMER
	def_bool n
	depends on UDELAY_LAPIC
	help
	  Expose monotonic time using the local APIC.

config UDELAY_LAPIC_FIXED_FSB
	int

config UDELAY_TSC
	bool
	default n

config UNKNOWN_TSC_RATE
	bool
	default y if LAPIC_MONOTONIC_TIMER

config TSC_MONOTONIC_TIMER
	def_bool n
	depends on UDELAY_TSC
	help
	  Expose monotonic time using the TSC.

config TSC_SYNC_LFENCE
	bool
	default n
	help
	  The CPU driver should select this if the CPU needs
	  to execute an lfence instruction in order to synchronize
	  rdtsc. This is true for all modern AMD CPUs.

config TSC_SYNC_MFENCE
	bool
	default n
	help
	  The CPU driver should select this if the CPU needs
	  to execute an mfence instruction in order to synchronize
	  rdtsc. This is true for all modern Intel CPUs.

config NO_FIXED_XIP_ROM_SIZE
	bool
	default n
	help
	  The XIP_ROM_SIZE Kconfig variable is used globally on x86
	  with the assumption that all chipsets utilize this value.
	  For the chipsets which do not use the variable it can lead
	  to unnecessary alignment constraints in cbfs for romstage.
	  Therefore, allow those chipsets a path to not be burdened.

config XIP_ROM_SIZE
	hex
	depends on !NO_FIXED_XIP_ROM_SIZE
	default 0x10000

config SETUP_XIP_CACHE
	bool
	depends on C_ENVIRONMENT_BOOTBLOCK
	depends on !NO_XIP_EARLY_STAGES
	help
	  Select this option to set up an MTRR to cache XIP stages loaded
	  from the bootblock. This is useful on platforms lacking a
	  non-eviction mode and therefore need to be careful to avoid
	  eviction.

config CPU_ADDR_BITS

config SMM_MODULE_HEAP_SIZE
	hex

	help
	  This option determines the size of the heap within the SMM handler
	  modules.

config SMM_MODULE_STACK_SIZE
	hex
	default 0x400
	help
	  This option determines the size of the stack within the SMM handler
	  modules.

config SMM_STUB_STACK_SIZE
	hex

	  This option determines the size of the stack within the SMM handler
	  modules.

config SERIALIZED_SMM_INITIALIZATION
	bool
	default n
	help
	  On some CPUs, there is a race condition in SMM.
	  This can occur when both hyperthreads change SMM state
	  variables in parallel without coordination.
	  Setting this option serializes the SMM initialization
	  to avoid an ugly hang in the boot process at the cost
	  of a slightly longer boot time.

config X86_AMD_FIXED_MTRRS
	bool
	default n
	help
	  This option informs the MTRR code to use the RdMem and WrMem fields
	  in the fixed MTRR MSRs.

config X86_AMD_INIT_SIPI
	bool
	default n
	help
	  This option limits the number of SIPI signals sent during during the
	  common AP setup.  Intel documentation specifies an INIT SIPI SIPI
	  sequence, however this doesn't work on some AMD platforms.

config MIRROR_PAYLOAD_TO_RAM_BEFORE_LOADING
	def_bool n
	help
	  On certain platforms a boot speed gain can be realized if mirroring
	  the payload data stored in non-volatile storage. On x86 systems the
	  payload would typically live in a memory-mapped SPI part. Copying
	  the SPI contents to RAM before performing the load can speed up
	  the boot process.

config SOC_SETS_MSRS
	bool
	default n
	help
	  The SoC requires different access methods for reading and writing
	  the MSRs.  Use SoC specific routines to handle the MSR access.
