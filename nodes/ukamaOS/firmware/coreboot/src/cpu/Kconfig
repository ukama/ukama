	  Select SSE in your socket or model Kconfig if your CPU has SSE
	  streaming SIMD instructions. ROMCC can build more efficient
	  code if it can spill to SSE (aka XMM) registers.

	  Select SSE2 in your socket or model Kconfig if your CPU has SSE2
	  streaming SIMD instructions. Some parts of coreboot can be built

	  Select this option if you want microcode updates to be assembled when
	  building coreboot and included in the final image as a separate CBFS
	  file. Microcode will not be hard-coded into ramstage.

	  Select this option if you want to include external binary files
	  in the CPUs native format. They will be included as a separate
	  file in CBFS.

	  A word of caution: only select this option if you are sure the
	  microcode that you have is newer than the microcode shipping with
	  coreboot.

	  The microcode file may be removed from the ROM image at a later
	  time with cbfstool, if desired.

	help
	  Select this option if you want to include external c header files
	  containing the CPU microcode. This will be included as a separate
	  file in CBFS.

	  A word of caution: only select this option if you are sure the
	  microcode that you have is newer than the microcode shipping with
	  coreboot.

	  The microcode file may be removed from the ROM image at a later
	  time with cbfstool, if desired.

	  If unsure, and applicable, select "Generate from tree"

config CPU_MICROCODE_CBFS_NONE
	bool "Do not include microcode updates"
	help
	  Select this option if you do not want CPU microcode included in CBFS.

	  Microcode may be added to the ROM image at a later time with cbfstool,
	  if desired.

	  If unsure, and applicable, select "Generate from tree"

	  The GOOD:
	  Microcode updates intend to solve issues that have been discovered
	  after CPU production. The expected effect is that systems work as
	  intended with the updated microcode, but we have also seen cases where
	  issues were solved by not applying microcode updates.

	  The BAD:
	  Note that some operating system include these same microcode patches,
	  so you may need to also disable microcode updates in your operating
	  system for this option to have an effect.

	  The UGLY:
	  A word of CAUTION: some CPUs depend on microcode updates to function
	  correctly. Not updating the microcode may leave the CPU operating at
	  less than optimal performance, or may cause outright hangups.
	  There are CPUs where coreboot cannot properly initialize the CPU
	  without microcode updates
	  For example, if running with the factory microcode, some Intel
	  SandyBridge CPUs may hang when enabling CAR, or some VIA Nano CPUs
	  will hang when changing the frequency.

	  Make sure you have a way of flashing the ROM externally before
	  selecting this option.
