	  Haswell can either start verstage in a separate stage
	  right after the bootblock has run or it can start it
	  after romstage for compatibility reasons.
	  Haswell however uses a mrc.bin to initialize memory which
	  needs to be located at a fixed offset. Therefore even with
	  a separate verstage starting after the bootblock that same
	  binary is used meaning a jump is made from RW to the RO region
	  and back to the RW region after the binary is done.
