	  Engine (ME), the Trusted Execution Engine (TXE) or something else
	  depending on the chip. This firmware might or might not be available
	  in coreboot's 3rdparty/blobs repository. If it is not and if you don't
	  have access to the firmware from elsewhere, you can still build
	  coreboot without it. In this case however, you'll have to make sure

	  Use me_cleaner to remove all the non-fundamental code from the Intel
	  ME/TXE firmware.
	  The resulting Intel ME/TXE firmware will have only the code
	  responsible for the very basic hardware initialization, leaving the
	  ME/TXE subsystem essentially in a disabled state.

	  Don't flash a modified ME/TXE firmware and a new coreboot image at the
	  same time, test them in two different steps.

	  WARNING: this tool isn't based on any official Intel documentation but

	  Read and write access permissions to different regions in the flash

	  The Intel Firmware Descriptor supports preventing write accesses
	  from the host to the ME or TXE section in the firmware
	  descriptor. If the section is locked, it can only be overwritten
	  with an external SPI flash programmer. You will want this if you
