	  Some mainboards with an ASPEED BMC have scrambled console output in early boot phases
	  because the serial output routing is not set up fast enough by the BMC. By enabling
	  this a delay of 500ms gets added before setting up the console and before any console
	  output gets printed.

	  Note: this problem may disappear with future BMC firmware versions. Another approach
	  is using a different BMC firmware like OpenBMC, u-bmc, ...
