	  Newest Memtest86+ version.

	  This option will fetch the newest version of the Memtest86+ code,
	  updating as new changes are committed.  This makes the build
	  non-reproducible, as it can fetch different code each time.

	  Select this option if you have a specific commit or branch
	  that you want to use as the revision from which to
	  build Memtest86+.  This makes the build
	  non-reproducible, as it can fetch different code each time.

	  You will be able to specify the name of a branch or a commit id
	  later.
