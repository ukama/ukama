	  Stable Yabits version.

	  For reproducible builds, this option must be selected.

config YABITS_MASTER
	bool "Master"
	help
	  Newest version.

	  This option will fetch the newest version of the Yabits code,
	  updating as new changes are committed.  This makes the build
	  non-reproducible, as it can fetch different code each time.

config YABITS_REVISION
	bool "git revision"
	help
	  Select this option if you have a specific commit or branch
	  that you want to use as the revision from which to
	  build Yabits.  Using a branch name makes the build
	  non-reproducible, as it can fetch different code as the
	  branch changes.

	  You will be able to specify the name of a branch or a commit id
	  later.
