	  This enables the 'ut overlay' command which runs a series of unit
	  tests on the fdt overlay code.
	  If all is well then all tests pass although there will be a few
	  messages printed along the way.
	  Be warned that it requires an out-of-tree dtc compiler with patches
	  to support the DT overlays, otherwise it will fail.
