	  ability to transfer small messages and/or notifications from one
	  CPU to another CPU, or sometimes to dedicated HW modules. They form

	  protocols.

	depends on DM_MAILBOX && SANDBOX
	help

	  back a modified version of any message that is sent.

config TEGRA_HSP
	bool "Enable Tegra HSP controller support"
	depends on DM_MAILBOX && TEGRA
	help
	  This enables support for the NVIDIA Tegra HSP Hw module, which
	  implements doorbells, mailboxes, semaphores, and shared interrupts.
