config DM_RTC
	bool "Enable Driver Model for RTC drivers"
	depends on DM
	help
	  Enable drver model for real-time-clock drivers. The RTC uclass
	  then provides the rtc_get()/rtc_set() interface, delegating to
	  drivers to perform the actual functions. See rtc.h for a
	  description of the API.

config RTC_PCF2127
	bool "Enable PCF2127 driver"
	depends on DM_RTC
	help
	  The PCF2127 is a CMOS Real Time Clock (RTC) and calendar with an integrated
	  Temperature Compensated Crystal (Xtal) Oscillator (TCXO) and a 32.768 kHz quartz
	  crystal optimized for very high accuracy and very low power consumption. The PCF2127
	  has a selectable I2C-bus or SPI-bus, a backup battery switch-over circuit, a
	  programmable watchdog function, a timestamp function, and many other features.

config RTC_DS1307
	bool "Enable DS1307 driver"
	depends on DM_RTC
	help
	  Support for Dallas Semiconductor (now Maxim) DS1307 and DS1338/9 and
	  compatible Real Time Clock devices.

config RTC_ISL1208
	bool "Enable ISL1208 driver"
	depends on DM_RTC
	help
	  The Renesas (formerly Intersil) ISL1208 is a I2C Real Time Clock (RTC) and
	  calendar with automatic leap year correction, 2-byte battery backed SRAM,
	  automatic power switch-over, alarm function and 15 selectable frequency
	  outputs.

	  This driver supports reading and writing the RTC/calendar and detects
	  total power failures.

config RTC_RX8010SJ
	bool "Enable RX8010SJ driver"
	depends on DM_RTC
	help
	  Support for Epson RX8010SJ Real Time Clock devices.

config RTC_MV
	bool "Enable Marvell RTC driver"
	depends on DM_RTC
	help
	  Enable Marvell RTC driver. This driver supports the rtc that is present
	  on some Marvell SoCs.

config RTC_S35392A
	bool "Enable S35392A driver"
	select BITREVERSE
	help
	  Enable s35392a driver which provides rtc get and set function.
