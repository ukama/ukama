config RAM
	bool "Enable RAM drivers using Driver Model"
	depends on DM
	help
	  This allows drivers to be provided for SDRAM and other RAM
	  controllers and their type to be specified in the board's device
	  tree. Generally some parameters are required to set up the RAM and
	  the RAM size can either be statically defined or dynamically
	  detected.

config SPL_RAM
	bool "Enable RAM support in SPL"
	depends on RAM && SPL_DM
	help
	  The RAM subsystem adds a small amount of overhead to the image.
	  If this is acceptable and you have a need to use RAM drivers in
	  SPL, enable this option. It might provide a cleaner interface to
	  setting up RAM (e.g. SDRAM / DDR) within SPL.

config TPL_RAM
	bool "Enable RAM support in TPL"
	depends on RAM && TPL_DM
	help
	  The RAM subsystem adds a small amount of overhead to the image.
	  If this is acceptable and you have a need to use RAM drivers in
	  TPL, enable this option. It might provide a cleaner interface to
	  setting up RAM (e.g. SDRAM / DDR) within TPL.

config STM32_SDRAM
	bool "Enable STM32 SDRAM support"
	depends on RAM
	help
	  STM32F7 family devices support flexible memory controller(FMC) to
	  support external memories like sdram, psram & nand.
	  This driver is for the sdram memory interface with the FMC.
