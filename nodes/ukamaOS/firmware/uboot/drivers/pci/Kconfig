menuconfig PCI
	bool "PCI support"
	default y if PPC
	help
	  Enable support for PCI (Peripheral Interconnect Bus), a type of bus
	  used on some devices to allow the CPU to communicate with its
	  peripherals.

if PCI

config DM_PCI
	bool "Enable driver model for PCI"
	depends on DM
	help
	  Use driver model for PCI. Driver model is the new method for
	  orgnising devices in U-Boot. For PCI, driver model keeps track of
	  available PCI devices, allows scanning of PCI buses and provides
	  device configuration support.

config DM_PCI_COMPAT
	bool "Enable compatible functions for PCI"
	depends on DM_PCI
	help
	  Enable compatibility functions for PCI so that old code can be used
	  with CONFIG_DM_PCI enabled. This should be used as an interim
	  measure when porting a board to use driver model for PCI. Once the
	  board is fully supported, this option should be disabled.

config PCI_AARDVARK
	bool "Enable Aardvark PCIe driver"
	default n
	depends on DM_PCI
	depends on ARMADA_3700
	help
	  Say Y here if you want to enable PCIe controller support on
	  Armada37x0 SoCs. The PCIe controller on Armada37x0 is based on
	  Aardvark hardware.

config PCI_PNP
	bool "Enable Plug & Play support for PCI"
	depends on PCI || DM_PCI
	default y
	help
	  Enable PCI memory and I/O space resource allocation and assignment.

config PCIE_ECAM_GENERIC
	bool "Generic ECAM-based PCI host controller support"
	default n
	depends on DM_PCI
	help
	  Say Y here if you want to enable support for generic ECAM-based
	  PCIe host controllers, such as the one emulated by QEMU.

config PCIE_DW_MVEBU
	bool "Enable Armada-8K PCIe driver (DesignWare core)"
	depends on DM_PCI
	depends on ARMADA_8K
	help
	  Say Y here if you want to enable PCIe controller support on
	  Armada-8K SoCs. The PCIe controller on Armada-8K is based on
	  DesignWare hardware.

config PCI_RCAR_GEN2
	bool "Renesas RCar Gen2 PCIe driver"
	depends on DM_PCI
	depends on RCAR_32
	help
	  Say Y here if you want to enable PCIe controller support on
	  Renesas RCar Gen2 SoCs. The PCIe controller on RCar Gen2 is
	  also used to access EHCI USB controller on the SoC.

config PCI_SANDBOX
	bool "Sandbox PCI support"
	depends on SANDBOX && DM_PCI
	help
	  Support PCI on sandbox, as an emulated bus. This permits testing of
	  PCI feature such as bus scanning, device configuration and device
	  access. The available (emulated) devices are defined statically in
	  the device tree but the normal PCI scan technique is used to find
	  then.

config PCI_TEGRA
	bool "Tegra PCI support"
	depends on TEGRA
	depends on (TEGRA186 && POWER_DOMAIN) || (!TEGRA186)
	help
	  Enable support for the PCIe controller found on some generations of
	  Tegra. Tegra20 has 2 root ports with a total of 4 lanes, Tegra30 has
	  3 root ports with a total of 6 lanes and Tegra124 has 2 root ports
	  with a total of 5 lanes. Some boards require this for Ethernet
	  support to work (e.g. beaver, jetson-tk1).

config PCI_XILINX
	bool "Xilinx AXI Bridge for PCI Express"
	depends on DM_PCI
	help
	  Enable support for the Xilinx AXI bridge for PCI express, an IP block
	  which can be used on some generations of Xilinx FPGAs.

config PCIE_LAYERSCAPE
	bool "Layerscape PCIe support"
	depends on DM_PCI
	help
	  Support Layerscape PCIe. The Layerscape SoC may have one or several
	  PCIe controllers. The PCIe may works in RC or EP mode according to
	  RCW[HOST_AGT_PEX] setting.

config PCIE_INTEL_FPGA
	bool "Intel FPGA PCIe support"
	depends on DM_PCI
	help
	  Say Y here if you want to enable PCIe controller support on Intel
	  FPGA, example Stratix 10.
