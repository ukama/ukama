Some Rules:
Subscrier is added with policy to store.
policy defines ULBR , DLBR , start time, end time, burst and data cap.

If new policy is assigned make sure the policy adds the left over data to new policy or apply new policy only when data is over.
In any case usage data will be reset to zero and will be be compared to new policy data cap  available.

On UE connection to EPC a create session request will be recieved and similarly end session on disconnect.
A go routine will monitor session data usage regularly from the ovs flows till the session is active.On session comleteion a CDR rport will be created 
and pushed to cloud. COntroller regularly checks for unsynced CDR reports in DB and pushes tehm to cloud.

Currenlty we have problms with end session whic is missing some time. Need to fix that from EPC.
