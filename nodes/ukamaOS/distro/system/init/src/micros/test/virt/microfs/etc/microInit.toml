# Config file for the microInit. 

# This files constitutes of two tables: 
#   1) Init config.
#   2) Init-bundles    
#

# Init Config: 
# Init config list all the bins required during init phase with image, version and path if required.
# 
# Init-bundle:
# These are singleshot containers started by init during bootup. These containers 
# are stopped once their task is  completed. Hence not required to be monitored.
# After init bundles are executed last step is to start microCE.
# 
# name = unique name of container which will be use to interact with it
# version := OCI image version. Default is "latest"
# 
# < Optional >
# image = image name which it is build from.
# path := OCI bundle path. This needs to be complete path. if not provided system would look at default path.
#
