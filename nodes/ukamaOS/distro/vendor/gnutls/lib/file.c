 * gnutls_load_file:
 * @filename: the name of the file to load

 *
 * This function will load a file into a datum. The data are
 * zero terminated but the terminating null is not included in length.
 * The returned data are allocated using gnutls_malloc().
 *
 * Note that this function is not designed for reading sensitive materials,
 * such as private keys, on practical applications. When the reading fails
 * in the middle, the partially loaded content might remain on memory.
 *
 * Returns: On success, %GNUTLS_E_SUCCESS (0) is returned, otherwise
 *   an error code is returned.
