@deftypefun {int} {gnutls_load_file} (const char * @var{filename}, gnutls_datum_t * @var{data})
@var{filename}: the name of the file to load

@var{data}: Where the file will be stored

This function will load a file into a datum. The data are
zero terminated but the terminating null is not included in length.
The returned data are allocated using @code{gnutls_malloc()} .

Note that this function is not designed for reading sensitive materials,
such as private keys, on practical applications. When the reading fails
in the middle, the partially loaded content might remain on memory.

@strong{Returns:} On success, @code{GNUTLS_E_SUCCESS}  (0) is returned, otherwise
an error code is returned.

Since 3.1.0
@end deftypefun
