/* Iterate over the virtual memory areas of the current process.
   If such iteration is supported, the callback is called once for every
   virtual memory area, in ascending order, with the following arguments:
     - DATA is the same argument as passed to vma_iterate.
     - START is the address of the first byte in the area, page-aligned.
     - END is the address of the last byte in the area plus 1, page-aligned.
       Note that it may be 0 for the last area in the address space.
     - FLAGS is a combination of the VMA_* bits.
   If the callback returns 0, the iteration continues.  If it returns 1,
   the iteration terminates prematurely.
   This function may open file descriptors, but does not call malloc().
   Return 0 if all went well, or -1 in case of error.  */
