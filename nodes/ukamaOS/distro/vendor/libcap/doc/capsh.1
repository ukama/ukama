.TH CAPSH 1 "2020-01-07" "libcap 2" "User Commands"
.SH NAME
capsh \- capability shell wrapper
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B capsh
[\fIOPTION\fR]...
.SH DESCRIPTION
Linux capability support and use can be explored and constrained with
this tool. This tool provides a handy wrapper for certain types
of capability testing and environment creation. It also provides some
debugging features useful for summarizing capability state.
.SH OPTIONS
The tool takes a number of optional arguments, acting on them in the
order they are provided. They are as follows:
.TP 22
.B \-\-help
Display the list of commands supported by
.BR capsh .
.TP
.B \-\-print
Display prevailing capability and related state.
.TP
.BI \-\- " [args]"
Execute
.B /bin/bash
with trailing arguments. Note, you can use
.B \-c 'command to execute'
for specific commands.
.TP
.B ==
Execute
.B capsh
again with remaining arguments. Useful for testing
.BR exec ()
behavior.
.TP
.BI \-\-caps= cap-set
Set the prevailing process capabilities to those specified by
.IR cap-set .
Where
.I cap-set
is a text-representation of capability state as per
.BR cap_from_text (3).
.TP
.BI \-\-drop= cap-list
Remove the listed capabilities from the prevailing bounding set. The
capabilities are a comma separated list of capabilities as recognized
by the
.BR cap_from_name (3)
function. Use of this feature requires that the capsh program is
operating with
.B CAP_SETPCAP
in its effective set.
.TP
.BI \-\-inh= cap-list
Set the inheritable set of capabilities for the current process to
equal those provided in the comma separated list. For this action to
succeed, the prevailing process should already have each of these
capabilities in the union of the current inheritable and permitted
capability sets, or the capsh program is operating with
.B CAP_SETPCAP
in its effective set.
.TP
.BI \-\-user= username
Assume the identity of the named user. That is, look up the user's
.IR uid " and " gid
with
.BR getpwuid (3)
and their group memberships with
.BR getgrouplist (3)
and set them all using
.BR cap_setuid (3)
and
.BR cap_setgroups (3).
Following this command, the effective capabilities will be cleared,
but the permitted set will not be so the running program is still
privileged.
.TP
.B \-\-modes
Lists all of the libcap modes supported by
.BR \-\-mode .
.TP
.BR \-\-mode= <mode>
Force the program into a
.BR cap_set_mode (3)
security mode. This is a set of securebits and prevailing capability
arrangement recommended for its pre-determined security stance.
.TP
.BR \-\-inmode= <mode>
Confirm that the prevailing mode is so named, or exit with a status 1.
.TP
.BI \-\-uid= id
Force all
.B uid
values to equal
.I id
using the
.BR setuid (2)
system call. This argument may require explicit preparation of the
effective set.
.TP
.BR \-\-cap\-uid= <uid>
use the
.BR cap_setuid (3)
function to set the uid of the current process. This performs all
prepations for setting the uid without dropping capabilities in the
process. Following this command the prevailing effective capabilities
will be lowered.
.TP
.BI \-\-is-uid= <id>
Exit with status 1 unless the current
.IR uid " equals " <id> .
.TP
.BI \-\-gid= <id>
Force all
.B gid
values to equal
.I id
using the
.BR setgid (2)
system call.
.TP
.BI \-\-is-gid= <id>
Exit with status 1 unless the current
.IR gid " equals " <id> .
.TP
.BI \-\-groups= <gid-list>
Set the supplementary groups to the numerical list provided. The
groups are set with the
.BR setgroups (2)
system call. See
.B --user
for a more convenient way of doing this.
.TP
.BI \-\-keep= <0|1>
In a non-pure capability mode, the kernel provides liberal privilege
to the super-user. However, it is normally the case that when the
super-user changes
.I uid
to some lesser user, then capabilities are dropped. For these
situations, the kernel can permit the process to retain its
capabilities after a
.BR setuid (2)
system call. This feature is known as
.I keep-caps
support. The way to activate it using this program is with this
argument. Setting the value to 1 will cause
.I keep-caps
to be active. Setting it to 0 will cause keep-caps to deactivate for
the current process. In all cases,
.I keep-caps
is deactivated when an
.BR exec ()
is performed. See
.B --secbits
for ways to disable this feature.
.TP
.BI \-\-secbits= N
Set the security-bits for the program, this is via
.BR prctl "(2), " PR_SET_SECUREBITS
API, and the list of supported bits and their meaning can be found in
the
.B <sys/secbits.h>
header file. The program will list these bits via the
.B \-\-print
command.
.TP
.BI \-\-chroot= path
Execute the
.BR chroot (2)
system call with the new root-directory (/) equal to
.IR path .
This operation requires
.B CAP_SYS_CHROOT
to be in effect.
.TP
.BI \-\-forkfor= sec
This command causes the program to fork a child process for so many
seconds. The child will sleep that long and then exit with status
0. The purpose of this command is to support exploring the way
processes are killable in the face of capability changes. See the
.B \-\-killit
command. Only one fork can be active at a time.
.TP
.BI \-\-killit= sig
This commands causes a
.B \-\-forkfor
child to be
.BR kill (2)d
with the specified signal. The command then waits for the child to exit.
If the exit status does not match the signal being used to kill it, the
.B capsh
program exits with status 1.
.TP
.BI \-\-decode= N
This is a convenience feature. If you look at
.B /proc/1/status
there are some capability related fields of the following form:
.nf

 CapInh:	0000000000000000
 CapPrm:	ffffffffffffffff
 CapEff:	fffffffffffffeff
 CapBnd:	ffffffffffffffff

.fi
This option provides a quick way to decode a capability vector
represented in this form. For example, the missing capability from
this effective set is 0x0100. By running:
.nf

 capsh \-\-decode=0x0100

.fi
we observe that the missing capability is:
.BR cap_setpcap .
.TP
.BI \-\-supports= xxx
As the kernel evolves, more capabilities are added. This option can be used
to verify the existence of a capability on the system. For example,
.BI \-\-supports= cap_syslog
will cause capsh to promptly exit with a status of 1 when run on
kernel 2.6.27.  However, when run on kernel 2.6.38 it will silently
succeed.
.TP
.BI \-\-has-p= xxx
Exit with status 1 unless the
.I permitted
vector has capability
.B xxx
raised.
.TP
.B \-\-has-ambient
Performs a check to see if the running kernel supports ambient
capabilities. If not, the capsh command exits with status 1.
.TP
.BI \-\-has-a= xxx
Exit with status 1 unless the
.I ambient
vector has capability
.B xxx
raised.
.TP
.BI \-\-addamb= xxx
Adds the specificed ambient capability to the running process.
.TP
.BI \-\-delamb= xxx
Removes the specified ambient capability from the running process.
.TP
.B \-\-noamb
Drops all ambient capabilities from the running process.
.TP

.SH "EXIT STATUS"
Following successful execution the tool exits with status 0. Following
an error, the tool immediately exits with status 1.
