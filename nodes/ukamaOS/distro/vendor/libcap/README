This is a library for getting and setting POSIX.1e (formerly POSIX 6)
draft 15 capabilities.

Natively supported languages are C/C++ and Go.

This library would not have been possible without the help of 

	Aleph1, Roland Buresund and Andrew Main, Alexander Kjeldaas.

More information on capabilities in the Linux kernel, links to the
official git repostitory for libcap, release notes and how to report
bugs can be found at:

# BUILDING AND INSTALLATION

	$ make

	       builds the library and the programs that are expected
	       to work on your system. For example, if you have
	       Linux-PAM installed, pam_cap is built. A golang
	       installation is required to build the Go packages.

        $ make test

	       runs all of the tests not requiring privilege

	$ make sudotest

	       runs all of the tests including those that require privilege.

	$ sudo make install

	       installs the library libcap.XX.Y in /lib[64]/
	       the binaries in /sbin/
	       the header files in /usr/include
	       the {libcap,libpsx}.pc files in /usr/lib[64]/pkgconfig

For some example programs look in the progs/ directory. Specifically,
capsh, getpcaps, setcap and getcap. Go example programs are to be
found in the go/ directory.
