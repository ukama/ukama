 *
 * This header, and the -lpsx library, provide a number of things to
 * support POSIX semantics for syscalls associated with the pthread
 * library. Linking this code is tricky and is done as follows:
 *
 *     ld ... -lpsx -lpthread --wrap=pthread_create
 * or, gcc ... -lpsx -lpthread -Wl,-wrap,pthread_create
 *
 * glibc provides a subset of this functionality natively through the
 * nptl:setxid mechanism and could implement psx_syscall() directly
 * using that style of functionality but, as of 2019-11-30, the setxid
 * mechanism is limited to 9 specific set*() syscalls that do not
 * support the syscall6 API (needed for prctl functions and the ambient
 * capabilities set for example).
 *
 * This psx library API also includes explicit registration of threads
 * if implicit wrapping the pthread_create() function is problematic
 * for your application via the psx_pthread_create() function. To use
 * the library in that way, you should include this line in the file
 * containing your main() function:
 *
 * -----------
 * #include <sys/psx_syscall.h>
 *
 * int main(...) {
 *
 *   ....
 *
 * }
 * PSX_NO_LINKER_WRAPPING
 * -----------
 *
 * This will ensure that your binary can link.

 * psx_syscall performs the specified syscall on all psx registered
 * threads. The mecanism by which this occurs is much less efficient
 * than a standard system call on Linux, so it should only be used
 * when POSIX semantics are required to change process relevant
 * security state.
 *
 * Glibc has native support for POSIX semantics on setgroups() and the
 * 8 set*[gu]id() functions. So, there is no need to use psx_syscall()
 * for these calls. This call exists for all the other system calls
 * that need to maintain parity on all pthreads of a program.
 *
 * Some macrology is used to allow the caller to provide only as many
 * arguments as needed, thus psx_syscall() cannot be used as a
 * function pointer. For those situations, we define psx_syscall3()
 * and psx_syscall6().
