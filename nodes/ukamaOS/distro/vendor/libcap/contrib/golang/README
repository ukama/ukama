This directory contains some test code for system calls that need
POSIX semantics to work under Go. There are 9 system calls wrapped in
a nptl:setxid mechanism in glibc, and the following development patch
adds support for these 9 to native Go.

https://go-review.googlesource.com/c/go/+/210639/

The Go support works with or without CGO_ENABLED.

With a patched Go runtime library:

  make
  sudo ./posix
  sudo ./posix-cgo

should validate that all is working as intended.

The above Go patch also exposes the mechanism that achieves this in
the Go runtime, to ensure that the native Go "libcap/cap" package can
work with and without CGO_ENABLED.
