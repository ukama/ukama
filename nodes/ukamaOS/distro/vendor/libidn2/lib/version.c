/**
 * idn2_check_version:
 * @req_version: version string to compare with, or NULL.
 *
 * Check IDN2 library version.  This function can also be used to read
 * out the version of the library code used.  See %IDN2_VERSION for a
 * suitable @req_version string, it corresponds to the idn2.h header
 * file version.  Normally these two version numbers match, but if you
 * are using an application built against an older libidn2 with a
 * newer libidn2 shared library they will be different.
 *
 * Return value: Check that the version of the library is at
 *   minimum the one given as a string in @req_version and return the
 *   actual version string of the library; return NULL if the
 *   condition is not met.  If NULL is passed to this function no
 *   check is done and only the version string is returned.
