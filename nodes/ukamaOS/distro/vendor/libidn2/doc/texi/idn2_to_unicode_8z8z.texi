@deftypefun {int} {idn2_to_unicode_8z8z} (const char * @var{input}, char ** @var{output}, int @var{flags})
@var{input}: Input zero-terminated UTF-8 string.

@var{output}: Newly allocated UTF-8 output string.

@var{flags}: Currently unused.

Converts a possibly ACE encoded domain name in UTF-8 format into a
UTF-8 string (punycode decoding). The output buffer will be zero-terminated
and must be deallocated by the caller.

 @code{output} may be NULL to test lookup of  @code{input} without allocating memory.
