@deftypefun {int} {idn2_to_unicode_44i} (const uint32_t * @var{in}, size_t @var{inlen}, uint32_t * @var{out}, size_t * @var{outlen}, int @var{flags})
@var{in}: Input array with UTF-32 code points.

@var{inlen}: number of code points of input array

@var{out}: output array with UTF-32 code points.

@var{outlen}: on input, maximum size of output array with UTF-32 code points,
on exit, actual size of output array with UTF-32 code points.

@var{flags}: Currently unused.

The ToUnicode operation takes a sequence of UTF-32 code points
that make up one domain label and returns a sequence of UTF-32
code points. If the input sequence is a label in ACE form, then the
result is an equivalent internationalized label that is not in ACE
form, otherwise the original sequence is returned unaltered.

 @code{output} may be NULL to test lookup of  @code{input} without allocating memory.
