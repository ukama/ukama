@deftypefun {void} {idn2_free} (void * @var{ptr})
@var{ptr}: pointer to deallocate

Call free(3) on the given pointer.

This function is typically only useful on systems where the library
malloc heap is different from the library caller malloc heap, which
happens on Windows when the library is a separate DLL.
