@deftypefun {int} {idn2_to_unicode_8zlz} (const char * @var{input}, char ** @var{output}, int @var{flags})
@var{input}: Input zero-terminated UTF-8 string.

@var{output}: Newly allocated output string in current locale's character set.

@var{flags}: Currently unused.

Converts a possibly ACE encoded domain name in UTF-8 format into a
string encoded in the current locale's character set (punycode
decoding). The output buffer will be zero-terminated and must be
deallocated by the caller.

 @code{output} may be NULL to test lookup of  @code{input} without allocating memory.
