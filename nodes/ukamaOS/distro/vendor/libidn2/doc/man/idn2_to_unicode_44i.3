.BI "int idn2_to_unicode_44i(const uint32_t * " in ", size_t " inlen ", uint32_t * " out ", size_t * " outlen ", int " flags ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "const uint32_t * in" 12
Input array with UTF\-32 code points.
.IP "size_t inlen" 12
number of code points of input array
.IP "uint32_t * out" 12
output array with UTF\-32 code points.
.IP "size_t * outlen" 12
on input, maximum size of output array with UTF\-32 code points,
on exit, actual size of output array with UTF\-32 code points.
.IP "int flags" 12
Currently unused.
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
The ToUnicode operation takes a sequence of UTF\-32 code points
that make up one domain label and returns a sequence of UTF\-32
code points. If the input sequence is a label in ACE form, then the
result is an equivalent internationalized label that is not in ACE
form, otherwise the original sequence is returned unaltered.

 \fIoutput\fP may be NULL to test lookup of  \fIinput\fP without allocating memory.
