.SH NAME
idn2_lookup_ul \- API function
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B #include <idn2.h>
.sp
.BI "int idn2_lookup_ul(const char * " src ", char ** " lookupname ", int " flags ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "const char * src" 12
input zero\-terminated locale encoded string.
.IP "char ** lookupname" 12
newly allocated output variable with name to lookup in DNS.
.IP "int flags" 12
optional \fBidn2_flags\fP to modify behaviour.
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
Perform IDNA2008 lookup string conversion on domain name  \fIsrc\fP , as
described in section 5 of RFC 5891.  Note that the input is assumed
to be encoded in the locale's default coding system, and will be
transcoded to UTF\-8 and NFC normalized by this function.

Pass \fBIDN2_ALABEL_ROUNDTRIP\fP in  \fIflags\fP to
convert any input A\-labels to U\-labels and perform additional
testing. This is default since version 2.2.
To switch this behavior off, pass IDN2_NO_ALABEL_ROUNDTRIP

Pass \fBIDN2_TRANSITIONAL\fP to enable Unicode TR46 transitional processing,
and \fBIDN2_NONTRANSITIONAL\fP to enable Unicode TR46 non\-transitional
processing.

Multiple flags may be specified by binary or:ing them together, for
example \fBIDN2_ALABEL_ROUNDTRIP\fP | \fBIDN2_NONTRANSITIONAL\fP.

The \fBIDN2_NFC_INPUT\fP in  \fIflags\fP is always enabled in this function.

After version 0.11:  \fIlookupname\fP may be NULL to test lookup of  \fIsrc\fP without allocating memory.
.SH "RETURNS"
On successful conversion \fBIDN2_OK\fP is returned, if
conversion from locale to UTF\-8 fails then \fBIDN2_ICONV_FAIL\fP is
returned, if the output domain or any label would have been too
long \fBIDN2_TOO_BIG_DOMAIN\fP or \fBIDN2_TOO_BIG_LABEL\fP is returned, or
another error code is returned.
