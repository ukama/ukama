.SH NAME
idn2_check_version \- API function
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B #include <idn2.h>
.sp
.BI "const char * idn2_check_version(const char * " req_version ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "const char * req_version" 12
version string to compare with, or NULL.
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
Check IDN2 library version.  This function can also be used to read
out the version of the library code used.  See \fBIDN2_VERSION\fP for a
suitable  \fIreq_version\fP string, it corresponds to the idn2.h header
file version.  Normally these two version numbers match, but if you
are using an application built against an older libidn2 with a
newer libidn2 shared library they will be different.

Return value: Check that the version of the library is at
minimum the one given as a string in  \fIreq_version\fP and return the
actual version string of the library; return NULL if the
condition is not met.  If NULL is passed to this function no
check is done and only the version string is returned.
