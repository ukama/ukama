  /* Test a less common code path.
     When malloc() is based on mmap(), free() can sometimes call munmap().
     munmap() usually succeeds, but fails in a particular situation: when
       - it has to unmap the middle part of a VMA, and
       - the number of VMAs of a process is limited and the limit is
         already reached.
     The latter condition is fulfilled on Linux, when the file
     /proc/sys/vm/max_map_count exists.  This file contains the limit
       - for Linux >= 2.4.19: 65536 (DEFAULT_MAX_MAP_COUNT in linux/include/linux/sched.h)
       - for Linux >= 2.6.31: 65530 (DEFAULT_MAX_MAP_COUNT in linux/include/linux/mm.h).
     But do not test it with glibc < 2.15, since that triggers a glibc internal
     abort: "malloc.c:3551: munmap_chunk: Assertion `ret == 0' failed."
