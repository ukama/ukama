/* Verify that in a situation where
     - an rwlock is taken by a reader and has a writer waiting,
     - an additional reader requests the lock,
     - the waiting writer and the requesting reader threads have the same
       priority,
   the requesting reader thread gets blocked, so that at some point the
   waiting writer can acquire the lock.
   Without such a guarantee, when there a N readers and each of the readers
   spends more than 1/Nth of the time with the lock held, there is a high
   probability that the waiting writer will not get the lock in a given finite
   time, a phenomenon called "writer starvation".
   Without such a guarantee, applications have a hard time avoiding writer
   starvation.

   POSIX:2008 makes this requirement only for implementations that support TPS
   (Thread Priority Scheduling) and only for the scheduling policies SCHED_FIFO
   and SCHED_RR, see
   https://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/9699919799/functions/pthread_rwlock_rdlock.html
   but test verifies the guarantee regardless of TPS and regardless of
   scheduling policy.  */
