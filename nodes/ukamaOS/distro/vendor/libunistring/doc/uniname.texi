@cindex Unicode character, name
This include file implements the association between a Unicode character and
its name.

The name of a Unicode character allows to distinguish it from other, similar
looking characters.  For example, the character @samp{x} has the name
@code{"LATIN SMALL LETTER X"} and is therefore different from the character
named @code{"MULTIPLICATION SIGN"}.

@deftypevr Macro {unsigned int} UNINAME_MAX
This macro expands to a constant that is the required size of buffer for a
Unicode character name.
@end deftypevr

@deftypefun {char *} unicode_character_name (ucs4_t@tie{}@var{uc}, char@tie{}*@var{buf})
Looks up the name of a Unicode character, in uppercase ASCII.
@var{buf} must point to a buffer, at least @code{UNINAME_MAX} bytes in size.
Returns the filled @var{buf}, or NULL if the character does not have a name.
@end deftypefun

@deftypefun ucs4_t unicode_name_character (const@tie{}char@tie{}*@var{name})
Looks up the Unicode character with a given name, in upper- or lowercase
ASCII.  @var{NAME} can also be an alias name of a character.
Returns the character if found, or @code{UNINAME_INVALID} if not found.
@end deftypefun

@deftypevr Macro ucs4_t UNINAME_INVALID
This macro expands to a constant that is a special return value of the
@code{unicode_name_character} function.
@end deftypevr
